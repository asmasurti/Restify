# Restify
A full-stack single page web application where users can search, book, comment and rate short term lodging experiences. Moreover, property owners can create listings for their rental units and accept reservations from users. The backend is implemented using Django REST framework and the frontend has been implemented using React. This project was created with a team of two other members for CSC309 which is a course at the University of Toronto on web development.
